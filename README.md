# DiaTrack: A Data-Driven Approach for Improved Patient Care by Readmission, Mortality and Diabetic Predictions

---

## ü©∫ Overview

**DiaTrack** is a research project developed as a group thesis by students pursuing their **BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**. Conducted in collaboration with the **Informatics Institute of Technology** and **Robert Gordon University Aberdeen**, and supervised by **Mr. Prashan Rathnayaka**, DiaTrack leverages data analytics and machine learning to improve patient outcomes by predicting critical health events.

DiaTrack is a **web-based decision support system** addressing major challenges in diabetes management. It integrates multiple machine learning models and a chatbot interface to provide the following functionalities:

- **Diabetes Risk Assessment**: Enables users to self-assess their diabetic status (diabetic, pre-diabetic, or healthy) via forms or a conversational chatbot.
- **Readmission Prediction**: Predicts 30-day hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients.
- **Mortality Risk Prediction**: Assesses in-hospital mortality risk, especially for ICU-admitted diabetic patients.
- **Chatbot Functionality**: Offers intelligent, interactive assistance for data collection and diabetes education.

## üîç Motivation and Research Background

- **Global Health Impact**: Diabetes is a rapidly growing health issue with severe complications and economic costs. In countries like Sri Lanka, many remain undiagnosed.
- **Healthcare Burden**: High rates of readmission and mortality among diabetic patients increase pressure on medical systems.
- **Research Gap**: While existing studies address individual aspects (e.g., diabetes detection or readmission), DiaTrack uniquely integrates **risk assessment**, **readmission**, and **mortality prediction** into a unified platform with a **conversational interface**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### üìä Data and Model Selection

- Utilized **three datasets** for:
  - Diabetes Classification
  - 30-day Readmission Prediction
  - In-hospital Mortality Prediction
- Conducted thorough experimentation with ML algorithms to select the most accurate models.

### üöÄ Development Approach

- **Agile (Scrum)** methodology enabled adaptive development with iterative feedback.
- **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** for modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

## üß™ Implementation and Testing

### üõ† Technology Stack

The DiaTrack project uses a modern, full-stack approach that integrates several key technologies:

![Tech Stack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c71b90-ec57-4191-8105-94539273c5f2)

#### Backend and Machine Learning:

- Python is used as the primary programming language.
- Libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and TensorFlow are employed for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- lask serves as the REST API framework that connects the machine learning models with the frontend.

‚Ä¢ Frontend:

- The user interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with React used to develop a dynamic and responsive web experience.

‚Ä¢ Chatbot:

- The system incorporates a conversational interface using the RASA framework, which handles natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management for collecting data and providing health advice.

‚Ä¢ Database and Deployment:

- MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store patient data and model results efficiently.
- The project utilizes version control with GitHub to manage the codebase and collaboration.

##### Libraries & Frameworks:

| Library            | Version |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| pandas             | 2.2.3   |
| seaborn            | 0.13.2  |
| matplotlib         | 3.10.0  |
| numpy              | 1.26.4  |
| sklearn            | 1.6.1   |
